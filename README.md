# Course Project -- Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the files needed for the Course Project -- Getting and Cleaning Data.

The details of the files listed in this repo are as follows:

# run_analysis.R

This script performs the following functions from the original data set:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# finalData.txt

This is the text file containing the independent tidy data set

# CodeBook.md

This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
